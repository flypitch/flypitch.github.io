Lean is an open source theorem prover and programming language being developed at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>.
Lean aims to bridge the gap between interactive
and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and
methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the
construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs.

The Lean project was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft
Research in 2013. It is an open source project, hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/leanprover/lean).

You can experiment with an
[online version of Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/live/)
that runs in your browser, or try the online tutorials listed under [documentation](../documentation).

Several users maintain the mathematical components library
[mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib) for Lean.
