The [Flypitch project](https://github.com/flypitch/flypitch) aims to produce a [formal proof](https://cmartinez.web.wesleyan.edu/documents/FP.pdf) of the independence of the [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis).

Our formalization uses [Lean](leanprover.github.io), an open source theorem prover and programming language primarily developed by [Leonardo de Moura](http://leodemoura.github.io/) at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com).

The Flypitch project was launched by [Jesse Michael Han](https://www.pitt.edu/~jmh288) at the University of Pittsburgh in August 2018. Work on the current codebase began in October 2018. As of April 2018, the project has completed a formalization of forcing and the unprovability of the continuum hypothesis.
